                    <p align="justify"> Apple hosted an iOS Development Workshop at their HQ in Cupertino solely for the NCWIT San Francisco Bay Area Affiliate Award Winners. At this workshop, a few Apple engineers guided us through the process of designing and coding a complex Scavenger Hunt mobile application. It was enlightening to talk to so many Apple engineers, especially since many of them had worked on fundamental components of Apple's software and development, such as the App Store, Maps, XCode, and Cocoa. </p>
